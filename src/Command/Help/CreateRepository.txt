The <info>%command.name%</info> command creates a GitHub repository and initializes it.

You can create a repository for a new project:
- with a description
- public or private
- with a default branch
- with files by default
- with labels for PRs and issues
- with contributors to invite
- with milestones
- with CODEOWNERS
- with CI pre-configured

You can configure lots of options using a yaml file.
To initialize the configuration file, run the command <info>init</info>.

On failure, by default, the newly created repository will be deleted. You can disable this behavior using the <info>--keep-on-failure</info> option. A delay also exists to abort.
